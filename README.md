we need few components and services
1) components : navbar
                contact-list
                view-contact
                edit-contact
                add-create

2) services :ContactService   

i have added routing in the file
when i route to home then it redirect to contact lists i.e; home (/) redirect to (/contacts/list)

For API calling 
we use json-server

json file-> db.json (contains everything)
